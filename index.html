            <div class="content">
                <p>    There is nothing that can come close to the love that a mother feels for her children.
                    Women are inherently good mothers. Till birth women carry their young and then continue 
                    their love & affection throughout their childhood and even into adulthood. Every Mother 
                    always makes sure that their children are safe and happy throughout their childhood. 
                    It is the love for their child that a mother feels that drives these feelings. 
                    No one can describe in words the feeling that a mother has towards her children. 
                    In fact, most people do not understand unless they become a mother themselves. 
                    Love always encourages us in any falls which come in life. She is the only person who has 
                    no demands except our best future.</p> 
                <p>   Mother is the most selfless person in this world who starts loving her children even before 
                    they come into this world. Nothing could be compared to a mother’s love in this world as it 
                    is the purest form of love. Mother is like an angel for her child, who always loves her child 
                    and supports him/her. For every child, his mother has a special place in his heart because she 
                    is the first person the child sees after his birth. This is the reason why a child and a mother
                    have a special bond between them. But not all people are fortunate enough to have mother love in 
                    their life due to many reasons. Those who have their mother with them must love and respect her.

                <h3>Mother as a Best Friend</h3>
                <img src="images/friends.png" alt="">
                
                <p> A mother is the first best friend of her child who instantly forms a special bond with the child just
                    after his/her birth.She understands all the needs of her children and always tries to fulfill them.  
                    After birth, a child finds his mom as the first friend who plays with him along 
                    with extra care and nourishment. She interacts with her child as a friend and keeps 
                    watching all her child's activities.A mother never feels tired while playing with her child and always 
                    fulfills all his demands without thinking of her. A mother is like an angel for her child.
                    <br><br>

                <h3>Mother as a Mentor</h3><br><br>
                <img src="images/teacher.png" alt="">
                <p>A mother is not just a first best friend of a child but also his/her mentor who always supports 
                    and guides her children to achieve all the success in life. A great mentor is one who always 
                    teaches you what is right and what is wrong. A mentor not only supports you but also becomes
                     strict with you when required. And we all can see these traits in our mothers.
                     <br>Without any expectation, a mother keeps on working for the betterment of her child. She plays
                      all roles including mom like a mentor, a teacher, a friend, a caretaker.
                     She loves her child more than any other thing in this world but sometimes she becomes little strict
                      towards her child for making him capable to fight with different circumstances comes in life. 
                      Mother gives us that power with which we become able to accept them and get success.<br><br>
                </p> 


                <h3>Mother as a Caretaker</h3><br><br>
                <img src="images/care.png" alt="">
                <p>No one can care for us as a mother does. She selflessly takes care of her child since the day he is born.
                     She knows all the needs of her child and can do anything to fulfill them. She is always there for her 
                     children. Whenever we get sick or ill, It is our mother who takes care of us without concern about her 
                     health. For a mother, the well being of her children is the utmost important, and she always ensures that 
                     her children remain safe and protected wherever they are.
                     <br>
                     A mother provides all the comfort to her child. It is the mother who makes the home cheerful and safe for
                      children. She is like a superwoman who can manage both household work and her responsibilities towards her 
                      children. Talking about my mother, she is adorable and compassionate. She loves all my friends and me.
                       Whenever I get sick, she gets concerned about me. She always takes care of my health and my needs. 
                       I love her the most and cannot imagine my life without her.<br><br>
                </p> 


                <h3>Mother as a Special Person of Our Life </h3><br><br>
                <img src="images/special.png" alt="">
                <p>After God, it is our mother who has the most special place in our hearts and our lives. Since the birth of a 
                    child, a mother forms a precious and special bond with him. Without thinking about herself, she thinks about 
                    her child and his happiness. She works day and night for her children so that she can make them happy. 
                    Motherhood is an integral part of a woman's life, and she selflessly gives her best to it.
                     <br>
                     A newborn child recognizes her mother from her unique fragrance. And before we start speaking, our mother 
                     understands our needs through our actions. This is all because a mother and a child share a special bond, 
                     which cannot be described in words. All a mother wants is the betterment of her child and to achieve that,
                      sometimes she supports her child and sometimes becomes strict with him. But her intentions are always pure
                       and honest. She always wants the best for us, and she does everything to give us the best.

        <p>    When we grow, we want to spend our lives on our terms and in doing so, many times we misunderstand our 
            parents. We become selfish sometimes and fail to understand her love, but she never complains or demands
             anything from us. All she wants is some respect and love from her child, and every child must provide 
             that to her.

        </p> 
        <p>   Mother's love is the purest form of love in this World, and Mother is the greatest blessing for a child 
            by God. As a child, it is our responsibility to value the sacrifice and efforts of our mother because all 
            she wants is the betterment of her child. We are very fortunate to have a mother in our life, and we must 
            respect our mother. We should give her all the happiness and love because she deserves all of that in return 
            for her selfless love for us.
